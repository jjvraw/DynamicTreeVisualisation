# DynamicTreeVisualisation

This is a project that uses the D3.js library to create a dynamic min-heap visualization in a node-edge tree diagram. The project is currently a work-in-progress, but can currently dynamically create and display a min-heap tree graphically based off a randomly generated array of ints.
